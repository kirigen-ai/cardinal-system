# Cardinal System - Autonomous Game World Management for Unreal Engine 5

Inspired by the Cardinal System from Sword Art Online, this project aims to create a powerful autonomous world management system for Unreal Engine 5 using modern machine learning and deep learning capabilities.

> **Vision**: To develop an AI system that can autonomously manage virtual worlds, generate dynamic content, and create deeply engaging player experiences through real-time adaptation and sophisticated world manipulation.

> **Note**: Cardinal System is currently in early development. While we're excited about the ambitious scope of this project, we're taking careful steps toward realizing this vision. We welcome community feedback and feature suggestions!
